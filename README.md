# msn-pops

A just-for-fun dev challenge I developed during my time at [Fueled](https://fueled.com/). 
The challenge was to create an app that focussed on pop-ups, and what better way to convey that than to remember the good ol' days of Windows XP.

You can view the fun here: https://reemhamz.github.io/msn-pops/.

Note that it's **not** mobile friendly.
